Simple 2D Graphics based on standard and portable OpenGL

# Current status
Basic implementation of graphics is available, including a range of named colors. 

# Goal
The intent of the library is to allow absolute C++ newbies to start writing functional and working C++ 
code within half an hour. The skillset so built should stretch until at least medium-quality 2D graphical 
games or other visualisation. The library should be set up such that you can take the things you made in 
the past and seamlessly transition into advanced 3D graphics and development by piecewise unwrapping the
library contents to their underlying implementations.

This means that many choices in the library are taken with the express purpose of being able to write 
smaller, more readable and more beginner-friendly choices. Many more advanced concepts are hidden entirely
and exposed in a very limited form, so that the users can get a start in more advanced effects, but without
needing the full mental model or complexity that would come along with the full detail. When two strategies
are either making it simple or making it efficient, choices were made to make it simpler.
